Specialized window for AntTweakBar parameters

Specialized window just for displaying a 2D RGB image

Scene
 - background gradient (how to implement this?)

how should things like depth-cueing be handled?
 - is it a property of the camera, or the viewer, or the scene?
 - its needed in the fragment shader, but controlled by the Viewer (right?)

where should information about rendering speed (or framerates) be
measured and organized?

Things from Deft to recreate (starting with most important)
 - basic isocontouring program (reorganize Roman's code for this)
 - Volume, as container for a gageContext
 - Colormapping
 - Triplane
 - TensorGlyph

------- Viewer ----------

with up fix, make it harder to get from-at aligned with up

limit results of depthscale so that you don't get near z-fighting

how can use "glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SAMPLES, N);"?  Note that it has to be set at
window-creation time, not adjusted after the fact ...
