Support for minimalist scientific visualization.

The main purpose of this library is to be a bridge between Teem and OpenGL3,
and to simplify writing programs that use Teem and OpenGL3.

With time and experience it may also include dependencies on GLFW3, GLM, or
AntTweakBar.  It will gradually subsume code from GLK's "Deft" project (which
is dead because FLTK2 is dead).
